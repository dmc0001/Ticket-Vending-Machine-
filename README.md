# Ticket-Vending-Machine-

The code begins by importing the java.awt and javax.swing packages, which contain classes for creating graphical user interface (GUI) applications in Java.

The TicketVendingMachine class extends the JFrame class, which is a top-level container for a GUI application. This means that the TicketVendingMachine class will have all the properties and behavior of a JFrame, as well as any additional properties and behavior that we define.

Next, the class declares several variables:

- ticketPriceField: a text field where the user can enter the price of the tickets they want to buy.
- ticketQuantityField: a text field where the user can enter the number of tickets they want to buy.
- paymentField: a text field where the user can enter the amount of money they are paying.
- purchaseButton: a button that the user can click to purchase tickets.
- ticketPriceLabel: a label that displays the text "Ticket price:".
- ticketQuantityLabel: a label that displays the text "Ticket quantity:".
- paymentLabel: a label that displays the text "Payment:".
- balanceLabel: a label that displays the current balance (the amount of money remaining after a purchase).
- ticketsRemainingLabel: a label that displays the number of tickets remaining for sale.
